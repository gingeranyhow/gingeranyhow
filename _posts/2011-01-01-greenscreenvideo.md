These  videos were created while I was learning greenscreening (for <a href="/projects/fedex/" alt="Fedex Acting Reel">this project</a>, actually). I was searching through videos and found a bunch with visible greenscreens (either shared pre-processing or posted as tutorials). I greenscreened the videos together and made these two compilations.
