<p>A video postcard. This is a timelapse video I shot in my room. It starts getting good around 19 seconds, so hang in there. For the days I was shooting, I couldn't turn on my lights after it got dark or stand in the 40% of the room that's visible. My favorite part is the red clover plant opening and closing to the day.</p>
<p>The words are cut out of cardstock, and the crystal growing recipes was adapted from one found online (involving liquid blueing).</p>
