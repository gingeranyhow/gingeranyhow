<p>
	From the late 1990s to the early 2000s, home movies were watched primarily on DVD discs. The main selection menu of these DVDs was often a short looped musical section played over animations or scenes from the film. Once a DVD reached the end of the credits, it typically returned directly to the main selection menu.

<p>
	For this reason, DVD-watchers would often wake up to the looped menu after a late-night movie. 
	Regularly, the noise and/or light-patterns had entered the watcher's dream in a fevered form.
